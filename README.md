# sql-scf-2021

Materials for January 2021 SCF workshop on databases and SQL

## Preparation

### Required

- Install either the RSQLite R package or the sqlite3 Python package on your laptop.
- Download [these data files](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/share/paciorek/tutorial-databases-data.zip) onto your laptop.

Alternatively, if you have an SCF account you can plan to use one of the SCF machines via ssh or the SCF Jupyterhub.

### Optional

If you'd like to be able to replicate the demo I do of creating a PostgreSQL database, you'll need to install PostgreSQL on your computer. Probably the easiest way to enable this is to install Docker, which will allow you to start up a Linux virtual machine on your laptop. See the [Mac instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) or the [Windows instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) for how to install Docker. We'll set up PostgreSQL within Docker during the workshop.

## Material

You can view the content by opening the `databases.html` file in a browser after downloading to your laptop, or by going [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/berkeley-scf/sql-scf-2021/blob/main/databases.html)
